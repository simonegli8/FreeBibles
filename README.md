# Biblia Libre

Biblia libre is a collection of OpenSource & Public Domain Bibles. The Bibles use a specific version of Markdown, BibleMarkdown. BibleMarkdown is normal pandoc Markdown, with the following extensions:

- You can put a marker ^^ at a place where you want to have a footnote, and put the footnote later in the text with regular Markdown ^[The footnote] syntax.
- You can have comments, surrounded by % signs, like %This is a comment%. A comment can span multiple lines.
- Verse numbers are noted with superscript Markdown notation, like this ^1^ In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. ^2^ This was in the beginning...

To edit the Markdown of the Bibles, you can use a normal editor like Typora, stackedit.io or VisualStudio Code.
