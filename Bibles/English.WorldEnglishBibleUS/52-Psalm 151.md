151This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though extra,+ 1:0 or, supernumerary composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath. ^1^ I was small among my brothers, and youngest in my father’s house. I tended my father’s sheep. ^2^ My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a lyre. ^3^ Who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself hears. ^4^ He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep, and he anointed me with his anointing oil. ^5^ My brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them. ^6^ I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. ^7^ But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
